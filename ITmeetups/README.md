# Project
Our country lacks the specific information source for programmers - be it hackathons, meet-up and other events like those, and we decided to create a web information portal which primary audience is programmers. 

As it's core, it should be an information portal. Each registered user should be able to leave a comment and register for an upcoming event immediately. An interesting feature that we are looking to implement, is the ability for users to form groups and search teammates for mentioned hackathons.
